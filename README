The Bears Radio is an adjustable audio delay box that is used to 
listen to the Bears radio broadcast while watching the game on TV muted.
The audio from the radio is piped through the box and delayed in
fine increments before it is sent to the speakers.  The delay 
resolution is as small as 1 millisecond and can be as long as
43 seconds. There is an LCD to display the settings and an RF remote,
so you can sit on the couch with your beverage while getting the 
sound of Ed Hochuli's voice to sync up with the TV.
